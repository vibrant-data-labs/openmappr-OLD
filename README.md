# PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REPOSITORY IS OUT OF DATE AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
## WE CREATED A NEW VERSION OF OPENMAPPR THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE HOSTING ON A COMPUTE SERVER
## THAT 'STATIC' PLAYER IS MAINTAINED HERE https://github.com/ericberlow/openmappr-player 
## YOU DON'T NEED TO CLONE THAT - WHICH IS THE INTERFACE "CONTAINER."
## INSTEAD YOU PUBLISH MAPS DIRECTLY FROM PYTHON USING "PY2MAPPR":

## Starting local development üë®‚Äçüíª
First you need to install the following prerequisites.  The installation instructions may vary based on your operating system.  Please review the prerequisite install guides listed above.
* Git
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Node.js 8.12.0 ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended)
* NPM along with the `yo`, `bower`, and `grunt-cli` packages
* Ruby along with the `sass` and `compass` gems


Then you will want to download or clone the project, and open up a terminal inside the project folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibrant-data-labs/openmappr.git
cd openmappr
```
After doing so, run the following commands to install all the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
bower install
```
To build the client and perform JS ops, run:
```bash
grunt
``` 
Next you will want to run the following command to bring up the local docker compose stack:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```
After it finishes, you can start the server with:
```bash
./run_local_mode.sh
```
And navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your web browser.

## Exiting local development üí§
To shut down the development server, press `ctrl`+`c` to exit, and then run `docker-compose down` to shut down the docker stack.
